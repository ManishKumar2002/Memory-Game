# Memory-Game

In this game, the player has some cards in front of him and all of them facing down initially. The player has to choose a pair of cards at one time and check whether the faces of both cards are matching or not. 
If the faces of both cards are the same, the moves(score) will get updated and then the player can keep those cards face up and continue. Otherwise, the player needs to put the picked cards back face down 
and continue by selecting other cards. 

This game has 2 levels. Level 1 has 6 pairs of cards and level 2 has 8 pairs of cards.

The game is build in HTML and CSS and the scripting is done in Javascript.
